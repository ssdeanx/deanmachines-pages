> A modern web application for visualizing and interacting with data from the Dean Machines autonomous drone platform. Built with React 19, Next.js (Pages Router), and Material UI.

## Overview

This project provides a user-friendly interface for exploring the capabilities of the Dean Machines autonomous drone platform.  It showcases real-time sensor data, flight paths, and contact information.  The application is built with a focus on performance, accessibility, and maintainability, leveraging the latest features of React 19 and Next.js. It is *not* the drone control software itself, but rather a *companion web application* for visualizing and interacting with the data generated by the drone platform.

## Features

* **Responsive Design:** Adapts to desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
* **Machine Catalog (Example Data):** Displays a sample list of machines (this section can be adapted to display drone specifications or other relevant data).  Currently uses placeholder data; integration with a live drone data stream is a future goal.
* **About Page:** Provides information about the Dean Machines project.
* **Contact Form:** Secure form using React 19 Actions, with error handling and loading states.
* **Customizable Theme:** Material UI theming with light/dark mode support (user preference).
* **Dynamic Metadata:** Sets page titles and descriptions.
* **Optimized Performance:** Server Components, Suspense.
* **Interactive Navbar:** Includes dropdown menus for easy navigation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (LTS version recommended)
* npm (or yarn)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/deanmachines-pages.git  # REPLACE WITH YOUR REPO URL
    cd deanmachines-pages
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

3. **Configure the API Endpoint (REQUIRED):**

    * Open `pages/machines.tsx`.
    * Replace `'https://fakestoreapi.com/products'` with a URL that provides data matching the `Machine` interface.  For initial development and testing, you can use a static JSON file served locally (see "Serving Static JSON Data" below).  *This is a temporary solution until you have a live data source from your drone platform.*

### Development

1. **Start the development server:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    ```

2. **Open your browser and go to:** `http://localhost:3000`

### Building for Production

### Deployment

Deployment (Vercel - Recommended)
Create a Vercel account: <https://vercel.com/>

Install the Vercel CLI:

npm install -g vercel

Deploy:

vercel

Follow the prompts. Vercel will automatically configure build and deployment settings for Next.js.

## Serving Static JSON Data (For Development)

If you don't yet have a live API endpoint for your machine data, you can create a simple JSON file and serve it locally during development:

Create data.json: Inside the public folder, create a new file named data.json.

Add JSON Data: Add your machine data to data.json as a JSON array. The objects in the array must match the Machine interface defined in pages/machines.tsx. Example:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "title": "Drone Model X",
    "description": "A high-performance drone for data collection.",
    "image": "/drone1.jpg",
    "price": 1200,
    "category": "FPV"
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "title": "Drone Model Y",
    "description": "A versatile drone for various applications.",
    "image": "/drone2.jpg",
    "price": 950,
    "category": "Surveillance"
  }
]
```

Add images to public folder: Make sure that the images you use are available in the public folder.

Update pages/machines.tsx: Change the YOUR_API_ENDPOINT variable to '/data.json':

```tsx
const YOUR_API_ENDPOINT = '/data.json'; // For local development with static data
```

This will allow you to develop and test the MachinesPage component without needing a live API. Remember to change this back to your real API endpoint when you're ready to deploy.
